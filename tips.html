            <h2>Cooking Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Mise en Place</h3>
                    <p>Before you start cooking, prepare and measure all your ingredients. This practice, known as "mise en place," helps streamline your cooking process and ensures you have everything you need at hand.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Let Meat Rest</h3>
                    <p>After cooking meat, let it rest for a few minutes before cutting. This allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in more tender and flavorful meat.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Season in Layers</h3>
                    <p>Season your food in layers as you cook rather than just at the end. This enhances the depth of flavor and ensures a more balanced taste.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Use Fresh Herbs</h3>
                    <p>Fresh herbs can elevate the flavor of your dishes. Add delicate herbs like basil or parsley at the end of cooking to preserve their flavor and aroma.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Taste as You Cook</h3>
                    <p>Regularly taste your food while cooking to adjust seasoning and ensure the flavors are balanced.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Preheat Your Pan</h3>
                    <p>Always preheat your pan before adding ingredients. This helps achieve a better sear and more even cooking.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Use a Sharp Knife</h3>
                    <p>A sharp knife is safer and more efficient than a dull one. It makes chopping and slicing easier and reduces the risk of accidents.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Boil Pasta Al Dente</h3>
                    <p>Cook pasta until it is al dente, or "to the tooth," meaning it should still have a slight bite to it. This prevents it from becoming mushy when combined with sauces.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Store Herbs Properly</h3>
                    <p>Store fresh herbs in the refrigerator, wrapped in a damp paper towel and placed in a plastic bag, to keep them fresh for longer.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Clean as You Go</h3>
                    <p>Maintain a clean workspace by washing utensils and wiping spills as you cook. This not only keeps your kitchen organized but also makes cleanup easier.</p>
